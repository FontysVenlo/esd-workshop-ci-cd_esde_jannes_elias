## Overview
Before automation, software development was a slow and manual process.  
Developers built and tested programs on their own computers, often using different setups and dependencies.  
When teams tried to combine their work, it often led to conflicts and failures.  
Releases were rare, complex, and risky because every environment behaved differently.

## The Beginning of Automation
In the early 2000s, the first continuous integration (CI) tools appeared to solve these problems.  
Tools like **CruiseControl (2001)** and **Hudson**, later known as **Jenkins**, allowed teams to automate builds and centralize testing on shared servers.  
This was the first major step toward consistent and automated development.

## CI Moves to the Cloud
During the 2010s, CI shifted from local servers to the cloud.  
Platforms such as **Travis CI** and **CircleCI** offered CI as a service, removing the need for organizations to maintain their own infrastructure.  
This made automation faster, more reliable, and accessible to teams of any size.

## Integrated CI/CD Platforms
From 2015 onwards, CI/CD became directly integrated into git hosting platforms.  
**GitLab CI** and **GitHub Actions** enabled developers to manage code, testing, and deployment all in one place.  
CI/CD now automates the **building, testing, and deployment** of applications, forming a complete development pipeline.

## Modern CI/CD
Today, CI/CD is a standard in modern software engineering.  
It ensures continuous testing, integration, and delivery, helping teams release higher-quality software more frequently and with fewer risks.  
The evolution of CI/CD demonstrates how automation transformed software development from a manual, error-prone process into a continuous and reliable workflow.
